> Given a list of product data, develop one endpoint to serve product listing. The number of products could grow to 10000+.
> You are free to choose any db, framework or boilerplate you want. Project should be written in typescript, js.
> We'd like to hear if you have any ideas how this can be extended.

## How to run
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.
2. In your console, point to the project directory then run ``npm run build`` then ``npm run start``.

You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to mock the API

## Routes
* ``/product-listing`` - grabs entire product listing
